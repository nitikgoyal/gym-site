					<h3>  Importance of Triceps Training</h3>
				<P> Triceps make up two thirds of your total upper arm size, compared to biceps that contribute only one third. Therefore, it’s obvious that your triceps deserve some more tough love than you’re probably giving them now. Everybody loves to obsess with biceps growth, while triceps rarely get their own spot in the limelight, which is a very flawed mass building strategy that will never produce the results you dream of.

Triceps development is a major contributor to building huge, balanced arms, as well as a significant factor in improving bench pressing strength. And the more weight you can lift, the more gains you can make. So there’s only one question remaining: what is the optimal volume for triceps training?

HIT, or high intensity training provides one of the best ways to establish the exact amount of training required to stimulate maximum muscle growth without falling prey to overtraining. It all depends on how much you’re willing to push yourself!

Truth be told, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution to this problem. As with most other training factors, optimal set volume depends greatly on the experience and recuperative capacities of the individual. Then again, if you train for failure but don’t use HIT variables, you might need to use a higher number of sets because even though the intensity of the effort is high, it isn’t as high as it would be with the addition of forced reps at the end of the set. On the other hand, more experienced lifters have better focus and are able to direct the resistance on the muscle more efficiently so they will probably require a lower number of sets.

If you have trouble finding the right volume for your individual set of abilities and goals, this guideline is the best place to start. Follow it closely and make sure to push yourself as hard as you can every time you train and visible results will follow quicker than you think.</P>

<p> At this point, the focus of your enthusiasm should be mostly on learning proper form and technique and mastering them to near-perfection. Without this crucial step, you’ll have low chances of success in the long term. Use 3-4 sets and finish one rep before reaching failure.</p>

<p>Burn reps, on the other hand, involve performing partial reps at the end of the set when contractile failure of the tissue doesn’t allow for any more full repetitions – they are different from cheat reps because unlike the latter, they require proper form to be maintained, and can be used as set intensifiers to enhance muscle building progress.</p>
