				<P> Truth be told, there are only a few secrets left to be discovered in the bodybuilding world, thanks to advancements in exercise science and accessibility of information, and it’s safe to say this especially applies to building huge biceps. Still, the countless ways in which known arm exercises can be performed offer different, unique stimuli for muscle growth, and by adding advanced training techniques to proven arm moves you can get an unconventional arm-blasting duo that will push you right into massive growth mode!

In this article we’re not going to tell you about some original moves with exotic names. We’re simply going to teach you how to perform well-known arm builders in a new, nontraditional way – one that guarantees overwhelming biceps and triceps development</P>

					<h2>#1. Single-Arm Eccentric Barbell Curl</h2> <br> <br>
<p> Curls are an unavoidable exercise for anyone looking to increase arm size. But this time, we want you to emphasize the eccentric portion of the movement, which is where the greatest potential for hypertrophy and power development lies. By focusing on the lowering part of the movement, you can powerfully overload your muscles and recruit more of their fast-twitch fibers, which leads to greater stress and greater adaptation.

You will use a barbell instead of a dumbbell, which serves to up the challenge and force your supinator muscles to work overtime to keep the barbell steady.</p>
                        <h2> INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>Get on a preacher bench, grab a heavy barbell with one arm and position it at the top of the movement. Then lower the barbell over an 8-second count. Pause briefly at the bottom and have your training partner assist you to lift the weight back up. What matters is that all of your work should be eccentric, so don’t curl the weight. Perform 3-6 sets of 3-5 reps.

					<h2>#2. Eccentric Reverse Fat Bar Curl</h2> <br> <br>
<p> Reverse curls are rarely seen in commercial gyms because most lifters are focused on performing exercises which allow them to lift as heavy as possible. But ask any seasoned athlete how he trains his arms and he’ll probably tell you that reverse curls have immensely helped him build those Tarzan-like biceps.

This is because the reverse curl primarily targets the brachialis, a muscle that lies underneath the biceps – when fully developed, the brachialis will push your biceps up higher and give them a much more majestic peak.

According to Charles Poliquin, you know that you’ve got massive guns of steel once you can reverse curl 80% of your regular curl max. And to get there faster, you will need to maximize time under tension by emphasizing the eccentric loading. In addition, the fat bar will allow you to train your grip and forearm strength like never before – and you definitely need those two to both perform better on heavy lifts and complete your monster look</p>
                      
                        <h2> INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
					<ul>
					<li>Select a heavy weight that will allow you to perform 4-6 sets of 3-6 reps and grab the bar with a pronated grip to work the brachialis better. You can use a closer grip than usual to intensify the contraction even further. Perform the concentric portion of the reps quickly but under control, without compensating through momentum, then lower the weight at a steady 5-second count. Make sure to keep your elbows tight to your sides – don’t let them drift forward and bring the front delts into play.
